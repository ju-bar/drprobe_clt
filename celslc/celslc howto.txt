#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------#


1) Installation

   Required files: celslc.exe (celslc) binary file
   Available for MS Windows, Linux, and OS X 64-bit systems
   
   
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------#


2) Purpose of use

celslc calculates the phase grating for multislice calculations on the basis
of an EMS-type supercell file or a CIF structure file for TEM in imaging or
scanning mode.
Result of the calculation is:
  (i)  Phase gratings in form of ems-type sli files
       (no propagator data is generated)
  (ii) Slice Parameters containing information about the generated
       phase gratings.
The slicing is done in equidistant steps or with each atomic plane along the
super-cell c-axis. This means that by default the slices are sorted along
[ 0 0 1], such that the first slice is located at the fractional coordinate
z = 0 of the super-cell. Alternatively the slice sequence can be created in
reversed order, starting with the first slice at z = 1. The latter option
corresponds to a [ 0 0 -1] projection. The electron scattering potentials are
calculated from atomic scattering factors as parameterized by A. Weickenmeier
and H. Kohl [Acta Cryst. A47 (1991) 590-597].

  > [] = optional parameters

Detailed explanations of options:

  Command parameters in [] brackets are optional and partially exclusive.
  The other parameters must be given, otherwise the program will terminate
  without calculation.
  
  
  -cel <string> = super-cell file (e.g. "atoms.cel")
  
  The CEL format of the super-cell input file is specified in section 5 below.
  
  
  -cif <string> = super-cell file (e.g. "atoms.cif")
  
  Supports standard CIF data as defined in [http://www.iucr.org/resources/cif].
  When both input formats are specified (-cel and -cif) the -cif option
  is preferred. The program requires one of these options to be present.
  
  
  -slc <string> = slice file name (e.g. "scl")
 
  The format of the output slice files is uncompressed binary raw data.
  The files contain a header and phasegrating data and can be used with
  the programs MSA and Dr. Probe.
  Warning: Slice files (*.sli) can be quite large depending on the
           chosen sampling.
  
         
  -nx <number>  = horizontal cell sampling (32 ... 2048)
  -ny <number>  = vertical cell sampling (32 ... 2048)
 
  The phase grating sampling must be specified by the parameters
  -nx <number> and -ny <number>. The numbers specify the number of pixels
  used to sample the projected electron scattering potentials. In order
  to allow for maximum speed of the scattering calculations, the
  sampling numbers should be composed of only small prime factors 2, 3,
  and 5. Samplings containing higher prima factors than 5 will cause
  increased calculation times.
  
  
  -ht <number>  = electron energy in keV (10 ... 1300)
  
  The kinetic energy of the incident electrons must be specified by
  the input parameter -ht <number>, where the number denotes the
  electron energy in keV.
  
  
  -nz <number>  = number of slices (0 ... 2048)
  
  The number of slices specified by the option -nz <number> initiates
  an equidistant partitioning of the super-cell along z. When this
  option is not used, the super-cell will be partitioned automatically
  into in general non-equidistant slices for each atomic (001) plane
  in the structure model. The threshold for atoms belonging to one
  atomic plane is a difference of the z position of less than a few
  picometers. Using the option -nz 0 will cause an equidistant slicing
  with an automattically determined number of slices, which represent
  the major (001) plane period.
  CELSLC calculates projected electron scattering potentials for
  each of the cells' slices. The z-sampling by slices is ideal if
  individual atomic planes are contained by individual slices.
  Remark:  Deviations from the actual atomic plane spacing due to the
           chosen slice sampling will consequently lead to deviations
           of the calculated electron diffraction. Especially higher-
           order Laue-zones (HOLZ) will not be placed at the correct
           diffraction angles in such cases.
           The programs MSA and Dr. Probe both support phase grating
           input with non-equidistant z sampling.
    
  
  -rev         -> slicing in reversed sequence
  
  Using the option -rev will reverse the slicing sequence by applying a
  mirror operation to the input supercell with the mirror plane
  at z/c = 0.5.
  Warning: Due to this mirroring 
           (i)  the electron diffraction will be reversed in z, and
           (ii) the rotational sense of the crystal system will be
                inverted, e.g. a right-handed screw is transformed
                into a left-handed screw.
  
  
  -fl          -> frozen-lattice simulation
  
  By applying the option -fl, the electron scattering potentials are
  displaced away from their equilibrium position by a random amount
  according to the specified thermal vibration parameter. The atom
  displacements are uncorrelated following the Einstein approach of
  thermal vibration. For frozen-lattice simulations you should combine
  this option with the option -nv.
  Waring: The option -fl will override and deactivate the option -dwf.
  
  
  -nv <number>  = number of FL variants per slice (1 ... 2048)
  
  The option -nv <number> specifies how many variants are calculated for
  each slice of the supercell.
  Warning: Slice files (*.sli) can become quite large for a large number
           of variants.
  
  
  -dwf         -> apply Debye-Waller factors
  
  By applying the option -dwf, the electron scattering potentials are
  convoluted by Debye-Waller factors.
  Warning: This option should only be used for small angle calculations
           such as for TEM image calculations. Due to the convolution
           the scattering power at large angles is drastically reduced.
  
  
  -abs         -> apply built-in absorption factors
  
  By applying the option -abs absorptive form factors are calculated
  according to A. Weickenmeier and H. Kohl [Acta Cryst. A47 (1991)
  590-597]. The option -abs can only be used in combination with the
  option -dwf. Using the option -abs will override and deactivate the
  option -abf.
  
  
  -abf <number> = apply fix rel. absorption
  
  By applying the option -abf absorptive form factors are calculated
  as a fraction of the elastic form factors. The fraction must be
  specified by the input number. The option -abf can only be used in
  combination with the option -dwf.
  
  
  -pot         -> export potentials to files *.pot
  
  By applying the option -pot projected electron scattering 
  potentials are saved for each slice of the supercell.
  Potentials are stored without the relativistic correction.
  
  
  -pps         -> output projected potentials to slice files
  
  This switch can be used to output projected potentials instead of
  phase gratings to the slice files.
  Potentials are stored without the relativistic correction.
    
  
  -ssc <number> = single slice calculation
  
  This option allows you to calculate the phase grating for one specific
  slice of the object. The slice is identified by an index number. The
  indexing starts form number 1 and goes up to the number of slices
  defined with the -nz option. This option may be used to calculate all
  phase gratings in parallel. Keep all other settings identical to an
  all-slice calculation.
  
  
  -prj <9 numbers> = new super-cell, re-orientation and re-sizing
  
  This option can be used to re-orient the input structure and
  use it in a new orthorhombic super-cell of given size. The
  orientation is given by the first 6 numbers, defining the new
  projection direction and a perpendicular direction for the new
  y-axis of the projection. All orientation vectors [uvw] are 
  specified in coordinates of the real-space input lattice. The
  size of the new super-cell is given by the last 3 numbers
  defining the extension in nanometers along each of the 3 new
  axes x, y, and z, where z is along the new projection direction.
  The origin point of the structure is not changed.
  Take care to supply sizes and orientations producing a periodic
  super-cell. Aperiodic super-cells may produce serious image
  artifacts at the super-cell borders. In particular slightly wrong
  super-cell dimensions in combination with atoms at the 0 or 1
  fractional coordinates of the new cell, may produce aperiodic
  structures. It is thus recommended to check the output carefully.
  If the used structure contains artifacts, please use a dedicated
  structure manipulation software to create an orthorhombic super-
  cell first.
  Example: -prj 2.,4.,1.,-2.,2.,-1.,0.79289,0.79289,0.79289
           This creates a new super-cell along the direction [2,4,1]
           of the input structure, with the new y-axis in a
           perpendicular direction coinciding with [-2,2,-1].
           The new super-cell is a cube extending 0.79289 nm
           along each of the new axes.
           
  
  -tla <3 numbers> = additional shift of atoms
  
  This option can be used to shift the whole structure in the
  chosen final orthorhombic super-cell by a given amount in
  fractional coordinates. All atoms are shifted by the same amount
  and their final fractional coordinates are wrapped back periodically
  into the range [0,1).
  Example: -tla 0,0.125,0.0625
           This shifts all atoms along the positive y and z axis
           by 1/4th and 1/16th of the super-cell dimension.

6) Structure and format of cel files

Super-cell data is the primary input data for celslc and in this sense also
for any program which takes celslc output as input data, e.g. msa.
Design the supercell carefully and keep the following points in mind:
- (A) The supercell is taken as periodic unit of the material. It may contain
      aperiodic structures which are however periodically repeated by the
      multisclice algorithm due to the multiple application of Fourier
      transforms. Thus, make the unit cell large enough to suppress unwanted
      effects of the periodic repetition. For STEM simulation this means, that
      the wave function, originally confined to a small area will distribute
      through the whole crystal lattice and eventually wrap around the applied
      real-space frame. Due to this wrap around, the electron wave might
      experience scattering by a possible aperiodic feature twice, which is
      not happening in the experiment. This problem is more likely to appear
      with a large object thickness. You should avoid a real-space overlap of
      components of the incident convergent beam, which is diverging again in
      the object.
- (B) Periodicity along the x,y, and z-direction may be exploited to generate
      small and few phase gratings an repeat their application in the multislice
      algorithm. However, for frozen lattice calculations with thermal
      vibrations, this periodicity is no longer existing.  Accordingly, you
      have to generate multiple variants of the originally periodic data and
      feed this variants to the multislice algorithm.
- (C) Large real-space frames, large number of individual phase gratings, and
      extremely fine real-space sampling (needed for high-angle scattering
      calculation) require a large ammount of memory and also computation time.
      Roughly precalculate the memory consumption and adopt sampling parameters
      to the capabilities of your PC.

Super-cell file structure:
General info: use ANSI character encoding when saving the cel file, separate
the values by at least one space character, use the "point" (.) as decimal

7) History of changes:

- 181128. JB: Version 0.70b
              Dr. Probe CLT source project trees combined in preparation for
			  depositing to GitHub. Makefiles are included.
              Text output has been reformatted in some splaces. Progress
			  indication occurs now only when several variants are calculated.
			  Max. phase shift warning is made only once for the whole cell.
			  Slice thickness is reported and the slice data parameter file
			  will be written in all slicing mode as long as slice #1 is
			  calculated. The output is suppressed with option -ssc n, n>1.
- 180702. JB: Version 0.69b
              Added output of form-factor decay k-values on -ffdec <value>
              and scattering power loss k-values on -f2dec <value>
              (Undocumented research feature)
- 180404. JB: Version 0.68b
              Added output for interaction constant and mean inner potential.
              Constants re-checked to be consistent with MuSTEM.
- 180321. JB: Version 0.67b
              Corrected a bug in the CIF loading routine. The space group
              identification should now work based on international table
              numbers or space group H-M symbols also.
              Corrected the name of space group 216 to 'F -4 3 m'.
- 171220. JB: Version 0.66b
              Reformatted std. output and added -verbose and -silent flags.
- 171214. JB: Version 0.65b
              Optimized Internal array management to reduce static memory
              consumption.
              Added run time information available with flag "-rti".
- 170728. JB: Version 0.63b
              Core code reformations for gaining about 30% speed in the
              calculation of projected potentials.
              Atoms sitting in identical sites (distance < 50pm) will now
              be displaced coherently as one site in a frozen lattice.
              Bug fix in the calculation of ionic potentials (hidden feature).
- 170720. JB: Version 0.62b
              Bug fix in the generation of phase gratings.
- 170719. JB: Version 0.61b
              Inserted bandwidth limitation on phase gratings.
              Reimplemented Weickenmeier&Kohl form factors with numerical
              integration of absorptive form factors.
              Replaced source file fscatt.f with wekoscatt.f90
              Corrected a scaling issue in the absorptive form factors.
              Inserted a trigger "-nsca 2" to switch to Waasmaier and
              Kirfel form factors instead of Weickenmeier and Kohl.
              Corrected an issue with string parsing for CIF file input.
- 170712. JB: Version 0.60b
              Removed atonum.f and atosym.f from the link list, the functions
              are no longer used.
              Added wakiscatt.f90 to the link list. This implements routines
              to use Waasmaiers and Kirfels x-ray form factor table.
              Added integration.f90 to the link list. This implements simple
              routines for numerical integration. Used for absorptive form
              factor calculations.
              Changed the magnitude of 1d random displacements calculated from
              Debye-Waller parameters Biso (input). The previous amplitudes
              were by a factor Sqrt(3) too small. Calculations with Debye-Waller
              factors were and are correct.
- 170710: JB: Version 0.57b
              Added Waasmaier and Kirfels x-ray scattering table for
              neutral atomic form factors for cross-checking purposes. This table
              is not made available in the public release.
              Inserted code triggers for potential generation and
              form factor oversampling and interpolation (CellSlicer).
              Reduced the propagator aperture from 0.67 to 0.66.
              Implemented the large angle propagator version (CellSlicer) in
              addition to the previous Fresnel propagator (paraxial approx.).
- 170630: JB: Version 0.56b
              Corrected a bug in the consideration of occupancy for ionic charge
              potentials.
              Corrected a small (insignificant) bug in one numerical approximation
              of terms involved in Weickenmeier's absorptive potential calculation.
              Added "L" as symbol for a vacancy in CIF i/o, also with charges.
- 170306: JB: Version 0.55b
              Added option -pps which is a switch to output the projected potentials
              in the slice files instead of the (default) phase grating output.
              The potentials are before relativistic correction.
- 161215: JB: Version 0.54b
              Corrected the documentation of the orientation input. All orientations
              must be given in real-space lattice coordinates.
- 160914: JB: Version 0.53b
              Omitting -nz when using 3D potential input forces identical sampling
              of the projected potential slices along z and is no longer causing
              a critical error.
- 160829: JB: Version 0.52b
- 160829: JB: Implemented a routine, which creates folders before writing files
              when the folder doesn't exist.
              The routine "createfilefolder" is using ifort libraries, so take
              care to adopt the code when using other compilers.
- 160724: JB: Corrected a bug that could cause additional atoms to appear on
              periodic equivalent sites after re-orienting the cell.
- 160518: JB: Corrected a bug that could cause crashes with some structures.
- 160316: JB: Corrected the unintended use of ionic potentials when using the
              standard (neutral) scattering tables.
- 160307: JB: Added text output about the used electron energy or wavelength.
- 160303: JB: Added functions for automatic non-equidistant slicing. The option -nz
              is now optional. The automatic slicing scheme is used by default when
              the option is not used. The traditional equidistant slicing scheme is
              used when the number of slices specified with the option -nz <number>.
              For numbers larger than 0, the given number of slices is created. The
              option -nz 0 will use the equidistant slicing with an automatically
              determined number of slices.
- 160302: JB: Version 0.51b
- 160301: JB: Removed bugs from the CEL and CIF loading routines.
- 160202: JB: Changed the spacegroup names to the recommended CIF standard.
              Added CIF file output after aplication of the -prj option.
- 160122: JB: Added the option -tla to shift atoms along the final (a,b,c) axes
              of the orthorhombic super-cell. The parameters of this option
              specify the shift vector in fractional coordinates of the cell.
- 160111: JB: Added CIF input via the option -cif. For calls where both input
              options are given (-cel and -cif), -cif is preferred.
              Added the option -prj to change the projection direction of the
              structure creating an othorhombic super-cell (block). (to be tested)
              CELSLC will now export a structure file named "CELSLC_used.cel"
              in the working directory, which defines the new super-cell obtained
              after changing the projection direction. This will not happen
              on calls without the -prj option.
- 160111: JB: Version 0.50b
- 151022: JB: Corrected a bug causing stack overflow in the 3D potential saving
              Changed the sign of 3D DFT potential input while reading to transform
              the potential to the same positive scale as used by the traditional
              isolated atom model.
- 151021: JB: Made the options -dwf and -buni <value> consistent in all calls.
              -dwf activates the use of Debye-Waller Factors globally, while
              -buni resets all B_ISO Parameters to the given value.
- 151021: JB: Version 0.42b
- 150609: JB: Brought 3D and 2D potential calculations to the diffraction limit.
              The way how the diffraction was limited in the previous versions
              was different. Effectively the 2D potentials now have a smooth
              cut-off between 0.8 and 1.0 of Nyquist. This should not change the
              diffraction calculation, since there an additional smaller
              aperture is used at 0.67 of Nyquist.
              Added the command-line option -buni <value>, which will set all
              Debye-Waller factor B_iso parameters to the given value in nm^2.
              3D potentials will be convoluted with a respective universal DWF.
- 150603: JB: Version 0.41b
- 150603: JB: Added the command-line option -ssc <number> for single slice phase
              grating calculations. Potential application for parallel computing.
- 150511: JB: Changed the way how external 3D potentials are loaded. The command-
              line argument -inf <number> allows to select the number of the
              data column. Currently there is 1 format supported. By setting
              -inf 10 you select the 4th column as the data columns. The setting
              -inf 11 selects the 5th column, and so on.
              This option is still hidden and not documented.
- 150301: JB: Added creation of atom data table for 3D potential based on
              atomic structure cel input file, triggerd by the option -3dp.
              This option is still hidden and not documented.
- 150130: JB: Version 0.40b
- 150130: JB: Support for larger number of slices up to 2048. The number of
              digits in the file slice names adopts to the number of slices
              specified by the "-nz" option.
- 150130: JB: Support for larger number of variants per slice up to 2048.
              The number of digits in file names adopts to the number of 
              variants specified by the "-nv" option.
- 150130: JB: Implementation for 3D potential generation (option: -3dp).
              This option is still hidden and not documented.
              Creates a 3D potential sampling the input super-cell as specified
              by options "-nx", "-ny", "-nz". Exports the 3D potential before
              relativistic correction in the working directory to a file named
              "pot3d-2.dat". Exports phase-gratings for each x-y-plane along z
              in slice files as specified by option "-slc". Multiple variants
              of 3D potentials are not supported.
- 150127: JB: Preliminary implementation of 3D potential input from external
              sources. (Undocumented)
- 150110: JB: Modified the structure factor calculation routine leading to a
              20% reduction in computation time for the potentials for case
              with a large number of similar atoms in the structure.
- 141217: JB: Implementation of atomic data and structure tables in the slice
              file header. This change may lead to an extension of the header
              and also to a shift of the data. The size of the slice files is
              no longer constant for one structure.
- 141217: JB: Version 0.35b
- 141125: JB: Slight modification of the structure factor computations.
- 140516: JB: Made the parameter [-nv <# frozen-lattice variants>] optional.
              By default 1 variant is calculated. A waring message is posted in
              case of a frozen-lattice generation with only 1 variant.
- 140516: JB: Added an option [-rev] to allow reverse slicing sequence along
              [ 0 0 -1]. The default slicing sequence is along [ 0 0 1] as in
              the previous versions.
- 140516: JB: Version 0.34b
- 131217: JB: Removed the implementation of static and vibrational atomic
              displacements along z in a slice. This concept turned out to be
              wrong.
- 131217: JB: Version 0.33b
- 131001: JB: Implemented input of scattering factors from FX-tables or
              FE-parameters. Due to the large potential of producing incorrect
              calculations, an explanation of this function and the required
              input format for the FX-tables or for the FE-parameters will be
              provided on request only.
- 130926: JB: Version 0.32b
- 130903: JB: Implemented static and vibrational atomic displacements along z
              in a slice.
- 130903: JB: Version 0.31b
- 130416: JB: Fixed a bug which prevented the creation of slices from a
              completely empty supercell.
- 121005: JB: Version 0.30b
- 121005: JB: Data structure, loading and saving routines for inelastic
              scattering data and extended header tables with equilibrium atom
              positions.
- 120324: JB: Version 0.23b
- 120324: JB: Corrected problems while reading incomplete supercell data, which
              could lead to a program crash.
- 120319: JB: Version 0.22b
- 120224: JB: Changed time-consuming 2D scattering factor precalculations to
              faster 1D version.
- 120224: JB: Version 0.21b
- 120224: JB: Added optional complex valued potential export to files *.pot,
              switch by -pot command line option.
- 110519: JB: Version 0.20b
- 110519: JB: Added again slice generation with constant absorption factor,
              option -abf <value>.
- 110406: JB: Version 0.19b
- 110303: JB: Added Scattering factors for hydrogen, fittet to Weickenmeyer and
              Kohl parameterization from the tables of E. Kirkland.
- 110209: JB: Removed a bug in slice title creation.
- 101209: JB: Added support for multiple variant slice files, new command line
              option -nv <num> determines number <num> of variants per slice.
- 101209: JB: Version 0.18b
- 101123: JB: Added slice title support, info on slice composition.

              Gaussian.
- 100222: JB: Version 0.15b
- 100222: JB: Added global parameters fft_dmin and fft_dmax for easier switch
              to different FFT dimensions
- 100128: JB: Version 0.14b
- 100128: JB: Removed a bug during max. phase shift checks.
- 100128: JB: Added the command line option "-dwf" to switch usage of Debye-
              Waller factors.
- 100128: JB: Renamed the command line option from "-nodwf" to "-fl" for frozen
              lattice calculation.
- 100128: JB: Changed the command line option "-abs". It wont take an
              additional value any more. Instead absorption potentials are
              calculated according to Weickenmeier and Kohl. This option may be
              overriden by the -fl option, requires -dwf option.
- 100126: JB: Switches compiler option for Parallelization ON
- 100105: JB: Added an aperture (cutoff in the range of 2/3 Nyquist to Nyquist)
              to the potentials during slice calculation, in order to prevent
              significant streaking in the real space potential when using
              undamped frozen lattice potentials.
- 100105: JB: Bug removed: Complex slice calculation, switched real to imag
- 091210: JB: Increased max. number of slices to 999.
